Creating a react application using Vite.
Navigate to your desktop and create a new folder. This directory will store all of our files.

Next, launch a command window and navigate to the app’s directory, as shown below:

Vite Directory

Note that we will be using npm in this tutorial. However, if you prefer yarn, you can access it from here.

Write the following command in your CLI.

npm init vite
We need to add a project and package name, as demonstrated below:

Vite project

We then need to select React as the framework and variant:

framework

variant

Our project is now created. Let’s install and then run it.

install

In the terminal, navigate into the generated project. In my case, ViteTutoral and type the command below:

npm install
installing

This command installs the required dev dependencies which you can access from the package.json file.

It also creates a node_modules folder which can be viewed as an external modules’ cache.

Your package.json file should look, as shown below:

Packages file

Finally, include the following command to start the dev server:

npm run dev
